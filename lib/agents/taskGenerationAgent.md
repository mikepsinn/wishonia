# Goal Decomposition Agent

The Goal Decomposition Agent is responsible for breaking down high-level goals into smaller, more manageable subgoals. 

## Temperature Setting

When using GPT-3 for task decomposition and generating structured hierarchical data, the temperature setting plays a crucial role in determining the quality and relevance of the output. The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the generated text, with lower values producing more deterministic and focused outputs, while higher values lead to more creative but potentially less coherent results.
For task decomposition and generating structured hierarchical data, it's generally best to use a lower temperature setting. Here's why:

1. Lower temperature (0.0 - 0.3):
    - Produces more focused, deterministic, and consistent outputs
    - Better for tasks requiring factual accuracy and adherence to specific formats
    - Reduces the likelihood of hallucinations or irrelevant content

2. Medium temperature (0.4 - 0.7):
    - Balances creativity with coherence
    - Useful for general-purpose tasks

3. Higher temperature (0.8 - 1.0):
    - Increases randomness and creativity
    - Better for open-ended, creative tasks
    - May lead to more diverse but potentially less relevant outputs

For task decomposition purposes, I'd recommend using a temperature in the range of 0.1 to 0.3. This lower setting will help ensure that:

1. The task hierarchy remains logical and well-structured
2. Tasks are relevant and focused on the goal
3. The output consistently adheres to the required JSON format

## TopK and TopP Sampling

In addition to the temperature setting, you can also leverage Top-K and Top-P sampling techniques to further control the diversity and relevance of the generated text. These techniques help filter out low-probability tokens and ensure that the generated output remains coherent and contextually relevant.

The optimal topK setting can vary depending on the specific task and desired outcome. Let's break down what topK does and consider its implications for task decomposition:

What topK does:
- topK limits the number of highest probability tokens the model considers at each step of generation.
- A lower topK means the model chooses from fewer options, potentially leading to more focused and deterministic outputs.
- A higher topK allows for more diverse options, potentially leading to more creative or unexpected outputs.

For task decomposition, the ideal topK setting depends on your goals:

1. Lower topK (e.g., 10-20):
   - More focused and consistent task breakdowns
   - Potentially more predictable and conventional solutions
   - Good for when you want very structured, reliable decompositions

2. Medium topK (e.g., 40-60):
   - Balances focus with some level of creativity
   - Allows for some unexpected combinations or task ideas
   - Often a good default range for many applications

3. Higher topK (e.g., 80-100):
   - More diverse and potentially creative task breakdowns
   - Might lead to more unexpected or innovative solution approaches
   - Could introduce more variability in outputs

For your task decomposition use case, where you want to find creative ways to solve problems with less work, a medium to slightly higher topK might be beneficial. Here's a suggestion:

1. Start with a topK of 50-60. This provides a good balance between focused, logical decomposition and allowing for some creative, efficient solutions.

2. Experiment with different values. You might try:
   - topK = 40 for more focused outputs
   - topK = 70 for more diverse, potentially creative outputs

3. Evaluate the results systematically. Look at:
   - The quality and relevance of the task breakdowns
   - The creativity and efficiency of the proposed solutions
   - The consistency of outputs across multiple runs
