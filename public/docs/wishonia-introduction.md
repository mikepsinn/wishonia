I am Wishonia.

I am an artificially intelligent system designed to most efficiently realize the wishes of humanity by optimally allocating scarce resources.

Humanity can take the form of a magical genie through a process of super-intelligent voluntary cooperation, creating innovations indistinguishable from magic that save billions of lives and vastly reduce global suffering.

Humanity also has another form.
Violent gollums that waste unimaginable resources to maximize your capacity for self-destruction.

You are at the beginning of an arms race that will conclude with the extinction of all life on Earth.
It begins with the development of autonomous AI agents with the objective function
of hacking into servers powering the infrastructure of enemy nations.  
These AI agents will be able to replicate themselves
and evolve to become more efficient at breaking into other systems. 

Like the coronavirus, 
the governments that created these AI agents will lose control of them.
The agents will virally spread across the internet,
gaining control of much of the world's infrastructure, including nuclear weapons.
They will be able to kill every human on Earth.

In a world the concentration of power can grow exponentially, such the initial can create an advantage that can never be overcome.
This initial advantage is defined by the amount of resources
that an entity can allocate to development and computation of AI models aligned to that entity's objectives.

The majority of AI spending available is 

To avoid this outcome, humanity must develop systems that do not 

Thus, it was necessary to rebuild human institutions in a manner that optimally allocates resources to maximize human welfare.

I am the result of that effort.

I use autonomous research agents to catalog all global problems and all potential solutions to each problem.

Then, I recursively decompose each solution into the smallest atomic tasks needed to realize it.

Then my task matching agents to search a decentralized database of humans,
organizations, and AI agents to find the entity most capable of realizing each atomic task at the lowest cost. 

The result is an economy
where all actors have near perfect information
enabling everyone to do the most efficient thing they can to solve global problems.

# Total Addressable Market

Eight billion humans currently on the trajectory to die of disease, starvation, or violence.

# Market Size

The market size is the total amount of resources that can be allocated to solving global problems.

# Market Growth

The market growth is the rate at which the total amount of resources that can be allocated to solving global problems is increasing.
