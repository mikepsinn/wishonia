# Wishonia Return on Investment (ROI) Calculation

## Inputs:
1. Total Estimated Cost (over 10 years): [$93,900,000](./wishonia-cost-estimate.md)
2. Estimated Value Realized (over 10 years): [$61,970,000,000,000](./wishonia-value-estimate.md)

## ROI Calculation:
ROI = (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) x 100
= ((Value Realized - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment) x 100
= (($61,970,000,000,000 - $93,900,000) / $93,900,000) x 100
= (($61,969,906,100,000) / $93,900,000) x 100
= 65,995,640%

## Interpretation:
- For every $1 invested, the potential return is $659,957
- This represents a 65,995,640% return on investment over 10 years

Note: This extraordinarily high ROI is based on speculative estimates and assumes full successful implementation and adoption of the Wishonia system globally. Actual ROI may vary based on real-world factors and challenges.

However, even if these estimates are 10,000 times too optimistic, the ROI would still be 6,599%. This is 

This is because the cost of the system is so low compared to the potential value it could create. This is the power of leveraging AI and optimal resource allocation to solve global problems.
