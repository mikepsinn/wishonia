## Simplified Positron Network Todo List

**Guiding Principle:** Start with a single, well-defined problem for a single non-profit, and build a working solution that demonstrates the value of autonomous agents. Then, generalize and expand from there.

**Phase 1: Targeted Solution**

1. **[ ] Choose a Focus:**
    -  Select a specific non-profit with a clearly defined mission and a task that could benefit significantly from automation (e.g., social media management for an environmental organization, grant research for a small education non-profit).
    - **Why?** Focusing on one specific problem allows for a more targeted and achievable initial implementation.
2. **[ ] Design the MVP Agent:**
    - **[ ] Define WIG, Lead/Lag Measures:** Clearly articulate the agent’s Wildly Important Goal and the specific, measurable metrics that define its success.
    - **[ ] Identify Tools & Data:** Determine the tools, APIs, and data sources the agent needs to interact with (e.g., social media APIs, grant databases).
    - **[ ] Develop the Agent:** Using a suitable framework like AutoGen or SuperAGI, create the agent’s logic, integrating with necessary tools and incorporating relevant knowledge.
    - **Why?** Building a functional agent first demonstrates the core value proposition before investing in complex infrastructure.
3. **[ ]  Build Basic UI (Optional):**
    - **[ ]  Simple Dashboard:** If necessary, create a very basic UI for the non-profit to monitor the agent’s activity, view results, and provide feedback.
    - **Why?** A UI can enhance user experience, but it can be minimal in the initial phase.

**Phase 2: Generalization & Expansion**

1. **[ ]  Abstract Core Components:**
    - **[ ] Agent Definition Template:**  Based on the MVP agent, create a template or framework for defining other agents, including fields for WIG, metrics, tools, and data sources.
    - **[ ]  Basic Network Structure:** Design a rudimentary system for hosting and managing multiple agents, potentially using serverless functions or containerization.
    - **Why?**  Abstracting core elements makes it easier to create and deploy new agents for different tasks or nonprofits.
2. **[ ] Onboard Second Non-profit & Agent:**
    -  Select another non-profit with a different mission and develop a new agent for them, leveraging the generalized components from Phase 2.
    - **Why?** Demonstrating adaptability to a different use case strengthens the value proposition for a wider audience.
3.  **[ ] Implement Basic Collaboration Features:**
    - **[ ] Shared Agent Library:**  Create a simple repository where nonprofits can share agent definitions and code.
    - **[ ] Basic Communication:**  Implement basic communication channels (e.g., forums, messaging) for nonprofits to connect and collaborate.
    - **Why?** These features lay the groundwork for a collaborative network effect.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Prioritize Impact Over Features:**  Focus on building solutions that deliver tangible value to nonprofits, even if they’re initially limited in scope.
- **Leverage Existing Tools:** Make use of readily available tools and platforms (like GitHub, serverless functions) to minimize development effort.
- **Iterative Development:**  Adopt an agile approach, releasing working versions early and iterating based on user feedback.
