# Agent Frameworks

- [SuperAGI](https://superagi.com) - infrastructure components, tools, frameworks and models to enable opensource agentic AGI
- [Autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) - enables the development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks
- [Open Agents](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenAgents) - includes Data Agents for data analysis with Python/SQL, Plugins Agents with 200+ API tools and Web Agents for autonomous web browsing
- [TaskWeaver](https://github.com/microsoft/TaskWeaver) - A code-first agent framework for seamlessly planning and executing data analytics tasks.

## Code Generation Focused

- [Sweep.ai](https://sweep.ai/) - reads your codebase, plans changes, and writes pull requests to address bug reports, small features, and refactors as described by the user.
- [ChatDev](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev) - Create Customized Software using Natural Language Idea (through LLM-powered Multi-Agent Collaboration)
- [MetaGPT](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT) - MetaGPT takes a one line requirement as input and outputs user stories / competitive analysis / requirements / data structures / APIs / documents, etc.
  Internally, MetaGPT includes product managers / architects / project managers / engineers. It provides the entire process of a software company along with carefully orchestrated SOPs.
