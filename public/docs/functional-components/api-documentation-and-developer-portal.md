# Wishocracy API Documentation and Developer Portal Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to outline the functional requirements for the API Documentation and Developer Portal component of the Wishocracy platform. The developer portal will serve as the essential interface for developers to interact with the Wishocracy APIs and leverage the platform's capabilities to build applications.

## Goals and Objectives

- Provide comprehensive API reference and documentation.
- Offer code samples and Software Development Kits (SDKs) in multiple programming languages.
- Streamline developer onboarding and authentication.
- Implement API versioning and deprecation policies.
- Enable API usage analytics and monitoring.
- Foster a developer community and support forums.
- Create an API marketplace and app showcase.

## Functional Requirements

### API Reference and Documentation

- **Detailed Endpoints:** Provide documentation for all API endpoints, including descriptions, request and response formats, status codes, and error messages.
- **Interactive Documentation:** Enable developers to interact with the API directly from the documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman.
- **Search and Navigation:** Include a robust search functionality and intuitive navigation to help developers find information quickly.

### Code Samples and SDKs

- **Code Samples:** Offer code samples for various use cases in several programming languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP).
- **SDKs:** Develop and maintain SDKs for major programming languages to simplify API integration.
- **GitHub Repository:** Provide a public GitHub repository for SDKs and code samples for community contributions and collaboration.

### Developer Onboarding and Authentication

- **Registration Flow:** Design an intuitive registration flow for new developers, including email verification and account activation.
- **API Key Management:** Allow developers to create, manage, and revoke API keys securely.
- **OAuth2 Support:** Implement OAuth2 for secure and standardized authentication.
- **Tutorials and Guides:** Offer a set of tutorials and guides to help new developers get started quickly.

### API Versioning and Deprecation Policies

- **Versioning Strategy:** Define a clear versioning strategy (e.g., v1, v2) for API endpoints.
- **Deprecation Notices:** Provide sufficient notice for deprecating older API versions, include timelines and migration guides.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure backward compatibility whenever possible to minimize disruption.

### API Usage Analytics and Monitoring

- **Usage Metrics:** Provide real-time analytics on API usage, including metrics like request counts, latency, error rates, and throughput.
- **Dashboard:** Offer a developer dashboard for monitoring API key usage and performance.
- **Alerts:** Implement alerting mechanisms for unusual activity or excessive usage.

### Developer Community and Support Forums

- **Community Forums:** Create and maintain online forums where developers can ask questions, share knowledge, and collaborate.
- **Moderation:** Ensure active moderation to maintain a constructive and supportive environment.
- **Support Tickets:** Provide a system for developers to submit support tickets and track their status.

### API Marketplace and App Showcase

- **Marketplace Directory:** Create a marketplace directory where developers can list and discover apps and integrations built on Wishocracy APIs.
- **App Showcases:** Highlight successful apps and case studies to inspire and guide other developers.
- **Ratings and Reviews:** Allow users to rate and review apps within the marketplace.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a growing number of developers and increased API usage without performance degradation.
- **Security:** Implement industry-standard security practices for API access and data protection.
- **Usability:** Ensure the developer portal is user-friendly and accessible.
- **Performance:** Optimize for fast load times and responsive interactions.
- **Reliability:** Maintain high availability and uptime.

## Existing Systems and Technologies

- **Swagger/OpenAPI:** An industry-standard framework for developing interactive API documentation.
- **ReadMe:** A platform offering hosted API documentation and developer portals.
- **Postman:** A collaboration platform for API development that includes interactive documentation and testing.
- **OAuth2:** A widely accepted protocol for secure authorization.
- **Google Analytics:** A service for tracking and reporting website traffic, which can be used for API usage analytics.
- **Discourse:** An open-source forum software that can be used to create a developer community and support forums.

## Conclusion

The API Documentation and Developer Portal is a crucial component of the Wishocracy platform. By providing comprehensive
resources, seamless onboarding, and robust support, we can empower developers to build applications and foster a vibrant
developer community around Wishocracy.
