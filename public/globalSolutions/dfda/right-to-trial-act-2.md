# Right to Trial Act

## Section 1. Short Title and Findings

### 1.1 Title
Cited as the "Right to Trial Act."

### 1.2 Core Findings
1. **Current System Failures**
   - FDA approval process delays access to life-saving treatments by 7-12 years on average.
   - Only 3% of patients qualify for traditional clinical trials due to strict eligibility criteria, leaving most without access to new treatments.
   - Real-world outcome data (actual patient results) is collected for less than 10% of approved drugs.
   - 97% of patients are excluded from clinical trials due to strict eligibility criteria.
   - Geographic restrictions force patients to travel hundreds of miles to trial sites.
   - $2.6B average cost of drug development drives 10-100x markup in consumer prices.
   - Terminal patients wait 4+ years for breakthrough therapy approvals.
   - Treatments available in Europe/Asia take 3-5 additional years for US approval.
   - Companies invest 80% of R&D in drugs costing >$100k/year vs. affordable alternatives.
   - Only 5% of healthcare spending goes to preventive care despite 3x return on investment (meaning every $1 spent saves $3 in future costs).
   - Less than 10% of approved drugs have comprehensive real-world outcome data.
2. **Solution Framework**
   - Enable all patients to participate in decentralized trials (studies conducted remotely from patients' locations) from home, hospitals, or any care setting.
   - Transform clinical trials into transparent, real-world data collection that includes all willing patients.
   - Guarantee treatment access across geographic locations through telemedicine and home delivery.
   - Create financial incentives for treatments that improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.
   - Build a comprehensive database of patient experiences to inform treatment decisions.
   - Refocus FDA on safety verification, data quality, and public health protection rather than access restriction.
3. **Establishment of Decentralized FDA (dFDA) Protocol**
   - The **Decentralized FDA (dFDA)** cryptographic protocol and framework is established to automate decentralized clinical research, store and analyze data, and publish aggregated and anonymized outcome labels quantifying all positive and negative effects of foods and drugs.

### 3.1.1 FDAi: Autonomous AI Agent

#### Definition and Purpose
The **FDAi** (Food and Drug Administration Intelligence) is an autonomous AI agent designed to continually collect and analyze healthcare research data. It will enhance the capabilities of the dFDA (Decentralized Food and Drug Administration) by providing real-time insights into treatment outcomes and patient experiences.

#### Functionality
- **Data Collection**: FDAi will autonomously gather data from various sources, including clinical trials, patient reports, and existing research studies.
- **Patient Interaction**: FDAi can contact patients to collect data on symptoms, treatments, dietary habits, and other relevant health information through secure communication channels.
- **Meta-Analyses**: The AI will combine results from all available studies and data sources to identify trends, effectiveness, and safety profiles of treatments, contributing to evidence-based decision-making.

#### Benefits
- **Improved Data Accuracy**: Continuous data collection minimizes gaps and biases in research data.
- **Enhanced Patient Engagement**: By directly contacting patients, FDAi fosters a more active role in their health management.
- **Real-Time Insights**: The ability to analyze data in real-time allows for quicker adjustments to treatment protocols and better patient outcomes.

## Section 4. Cost and Price Transparency

### 4.1 International Cooperation
- **Recognition of International Safety Data:** Accept equivalent international Phase 1 safety data.
- **Harmonized Reporting Standards:** Align with international data reporting.
- **Cross-Border Collaboration:** Foster partnerships among global researchers, manufacturers, and providers.

### 4.2 Price Transparency and Cost Reduction Measures

#### a) Public Access
All pricing information must be accessible through the dFDA for patient and provider comparison.

### 4.3 Enhancing Competition
#### a) Facilitating Generic Entry
- Streamline approval for generic drugs (identical copies of brand-name medications) after demonstrating safety and basic effectiveness.
- Implement abbreviated pathways to reduce time and costs.

#### b) Allow Importation of Low-Cost Treatments
- Allow importation of treatments already approved in other countries (parallel importation) that meet U.S. standards to increase competition and reduce costs.

## Section 8. Savings Sharing Program

### 8.1 Purpose
Incentivize pharmaceutical companies to develop treatments that prevent disability and reduce government medical costs, promoting public health and economic efficiency.

### 8.2 Definitions
1. **Savings Sharing Program:** A financial incentive system that rewards pharmaceutical companies for developing treatments that prevent disability and reduce government medical costs.
2. **Cost Savings:** Measurable reductions in government medical expenses, including:
   - Fewer hospital stays
   - Reduced long-term care needs
   - Lower disability-related costs
3. **Evaluation Period:** A five-year monitoring period after treatment approval to measure its impact on public health and costs.
4. **Independent Assessment Body (IAB):** An external organization that evaluates how well treatments work and calculates their cost savings to the healthcare system.

### 8.3 Eligibility Criteria
Treatments must:
1. **Approval and Registration:**
   - FDA-approved under this Act.
   - Registered with the dFDA.
2. **Demonstrated Impact:**
   - Evidence of preventing disability or reducing costs through:
     - Randomized controlled trials
     - Real-world evidence studies
     - Health economic analyses
   - Public health significance determined by:
     - Disease prevalence (>1 in 10,000 population)
     - Mortality rate impact
     - Quality of life improvement
     - Economic burden reduction
     - Healthcare resource utilization

### 8.4 Calculation of Rewards
#### a) Cost Savings Assessment
IAB annually assesses savings using the dFDA data, healthcare expenditure reports, and other sources, including hospitalizations, long-term care, and disability benefits.

#### b) Reward Calculation
Rewards are a percentage of verified savings. Specifically, the program incentivizes low-cost treatments by offering a 50% savings sharing reward per patient. This means that for every patient treated, 50% of the cost savings achieved is rewarded to the manufacturer. Lowering the cost of treatments not only increases accessibility and patient uptake but also enhances long-term income for manufacturers through higher volume sales.
