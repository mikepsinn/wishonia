# RIGHT TO TRIAL ACT

## SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS

### 1.1 Title
This Act may be cited as the "Right to Trial Act"

### 1.2 Core Problems This Act Solves

Today's healthcare system is broken because:
* Life-saving treatments are blocked by FDA delays averaging 7-12 years
* 97% of patients are excluded from clinical trials, denying them access to promising treatments
* Drug development costs average $2.6B, driving companies to focus on expensive treatments
* 80% of R&D goes to drugs costing over $100k/year rather than affordable alternatives
* Terminal patients wait 4+ years for breakthrough therapy approvals
* US approvals lag 3-5 years behind Europe and Asia
* Only 5% of healthcare spending goes to preventive care, despite every $1 spent saving $3 in future costs
* The system ignores real-world evidence about which treatments actually work

### 1.3 The Solution

This Act:
* Guarantees every person's right to try any treatment that passes basic safety testing
* Creates a free, open platform that eliminates billions in unnecessary trial costs
* Rewards companies for developing actual cures and prevention
* Removes artificial barriers blocking access to treatments that work
* Measures and rewards real-world results through comprehensive data collection
* Establishes an AI-powered system (FDAi) to continuously analyze treatment outcomes

### 1.4 Economic Impact

This Act will:
* Cut clinical trial costs by over 90% through free open infrastructure
* Save over $2 trillion annually by incentivizing disease prevention
* Reduce time-to-market by years through universal trial participation
* Creat multi-billion dollar rewards for companies that develop actual cures
* Enable real price competition through global access and transparent outcomes

## SECTION 2. OPEN SOURCE GLOBAL DECENTRALIZED TRIAL PLATFORM

### 2.1 Transforming Safety and Efficacy Testing

A free public decentralized trial platform will:
* Replace traditional Phase 1-4 trials with continuous real-world evidence collection
* Enable more efficient safety testing through remote monitoring and rapid signal detection
* Track safety and effectiveness automatically across the entire healthcare system
* Generate better evidence faster through universal participation
* Enable rapid identification of which treatments work best for whom

### 2.2 Universal Participation
The platform enables:
* Broader testing with more diverse participants
* Any patient to participate
* Home and remote participation through telemedicine
* Patient monitoring through mobile devices and apps
* Automated outcome tracking through electronic health records and other data sources
* Direct patient reporting of experiences and results
* Continuous collection of real-world evidence

### 2.3 FDAi: Autonomous Agent
The FDAi continuously:
* Analyzes all available research and patient data
* Quantifies positive and negative effects of all:
  * Pharmaceutical drugs
  * Food products and ingredients
  * Dietary patterns
  * Treatment combinations
* Provides early warning of potential safety issues
* Identifies optimal treatments for specific patient profiles
* Monitors population-level health outcomes
* Tracks food-drug interactions and dietary impacts

## SECTION 3. UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO TREATMENTS

### 3.1 Breaking Down Barriers
After basic safety testing, any patient can:
* Join trials for the most promising treatments
* Participate from home or any location
* Access treatments from any country
* Use telemedicine or local providers
* Share their results to help others

### 3.2 No More Artificial Restrictions
The FDA and states cannot:
* Block informed patient access to treatments
* Force patients to travel for treatment
* Prevent doctors from offering treatments
* Ban importing of medicines from other countries
* Interfere with home or local treatment options
* Block telemedicine access

### 3.3 Empowering Doctors
All healthcare providers can:
* Offer proven treatments anywhere
* Import treatments for patients
* Provide care at home
* Use remote monitoring
* Cross state lines to help patients
* Share results through the platform with patient consent

## SECTION 4. FREE OPEN SOURCE TRIAL PLATFORM

### 4.1 Replacing Expensive Systems
A decentralized trial platform will:
* Handle all trial data collection
* Track real-world outcomes
* Monitor safety automatically
* Analyze what works best
* Connect patients and doctors
* Share results globally
* Automate trial recruitment, monitoring, and analysis

### 4.2 Eliminating Unnecessary Costs
The platform eliminates expenses for:
* Trial software and systems
* Patient monitoring tools
* Data collection and storage
* Analysis and reporting
* Compliance tracking
* Security infrastructure

### 4.3 Better Data, Better Decisions
The platform automatically:
* Matches similar patients
* Identifies optimal treatments based on real-world outcomes
* Spots potential problems early
* Shows comparative effectiveness
* Compares treatment costs
* Helps patients find optimal care

### 4.4 Open To Everyone
Anyone can:
* Access aggregated and anonymized trial data
* Build new analysis tools to integrate with the platform
* Create patient apps
* Improve the platform
* Add new features

### 4.5 Global Collaboration
The platform supports:
* Recognition of international safety data
* Harmonized global reporting standards
* Cross-border research collaboration
* Transparent pricing across regions
* International treatment access

## SECTION 5. FINANCIAL INCENTIVES

### 5.1 Removing Barriers To Treatment Development and Accessibility
* No user fees imposed on those developing new treatments
* Congressional funding for platform maintenance
* Free importation of lower-cost treatments

### 5.2 Healthcare Savings Sharing Program

The program incentivizes manufacturers to develop and provide affordable preventative treatments by sharing the resulting healthcare cost savings:

* Manufacturers receive 50% of verified healthcare savings when their treatments:
  * Prevent diseases or health conditions
  * Reduce long-term healthcare costs
  * Improve health outcomes
  
* Key benefits:
  * Encourages development of preventative treatments (like klotho gene therapy)
  * Motivates low pricing since wider patient adoption = more shared savings
  * Creates sustainable funding through actual cost reductions
  * Aligns manufacturer profits with public health outcomes

* Implementation:
  * Savings calculated from anonymized healthcare data stored by the dFDA
  * Independent verification of cost reductions

## SECTION 6. BENEFITS OVER CURRENT SYSTEM

### 6.1 Cheaper
* Eliminates billions in redundant trial infrastructure costs
* Removes expensive middlemen and administrative overhead
* Enables global price competition through open access
* Shares cost savings from prevention back to developers
* Reduces healthcare spending through earlier intervention
* Cuts development costs by over 90% through shared platform
* Eliminates duplicate safety testing across regions

### 6.2 Faster
* Removes years of administrative delays
* Enables immediate trial participation for interested patients
* Automates patient matching and enrollment
* Provides real-time safety and efficacy monitoring
* Accelerates treatment optimization through AI analysis
* Eliminates redundant approval processes across countries
* Enables rapid iteration based on real-world evidence

### 6.3 Better
* Includes all willing patients instead of just 3%
* Generates real-world evidence across diverse populations
* Identifies optimal treatments for specific patient profiles
* Catches safety issues earlier through comprehensive monitoring
* Enables continuous improvement through global collaboration
* Aligns profit incentives with actual health outcomes
* Democratizes access to promising treatments
