Data collection can be done using wearable sensors, third-party applications, and client applications.

### Data Types

Ultimately, the system should be able to handle the following data types:

* Omics data (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.)
* Image and physiological data (e.g., CT, PET/SPECT, sMRI, fMRI, rMRI, DTI, EEG, MEG, ultrasound, cellular level imaging, multi-electrode recording, etc.)
* Clinical data (e.g., lab tests, pathology, imaging, diagnosis, electronic health records, etc.)
* Multiscale data (genomic, epigenomic, subcellular, cellular, network, organ, systems, organism, population levels)
* Multiplatform data (desktop, cloud-based storage, etc.)
* Data from multiple research areas and diseases (e.g., common inflammatory pathways in cancer, obesity, immune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases)
* Data with special considerations (e.g., sparse data, heterogeneous data, very large or very small datasets)
* Human-computer interfaces and visualization

### Automated Data Acquisition

At the present time, it requires a great deal of effort and diligence on the part of the self-tracker to gather all the data required to identify the triggers of mental illness and quantify the effectiveness of different treatments. Tracking oneâ€™s mood, diet, sleep, activity, and medication intake can be extremely time-consuming. The present invention automatically pulls data from a number of data sources (adding more all the time).

The data sources would include:

* Biometric Devices: that could measure vital signs and biomarkers
* Purchase Records: Data regarding consumption of foods and supplements could be automatically collected by and inferred from receipts or other financial aggregation services like Mint.com.
* Auditory Records: Voice recognition may be used to quantify emotion through conscious verbal expression, spectral analysis of the magnitudes of different frequencies of speech would probably be a better means of quantifying unconscious human affect and thus providing more accurate data for the machine learning process. CommonSense is a cloud-based platform for sensor data.
* Visual Affect Data via Web-Cameras: By tracking hundreds of points on the subjectsâ€™ faces, InSight can accurately capture emotional states.
* Prescription Records: Microsoft HealthVault can automatically collect lab results, prescription history, and visit records from a growing list of labs, pharmacies, hospitals, and clinics.
