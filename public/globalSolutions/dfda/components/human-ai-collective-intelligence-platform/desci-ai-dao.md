# Problem:

- **Coordination** - Lack of inter-DAO coordination leads to duplication of efforts and stalled progress

- **Resource allocation** - Lack of intra-DAO coordination causes inefficient resource allocation

- **Mindsets** - Competitive mindsets prevent open collaboration between members

- **Prioritization** - No systemic way to prioritize high-impact tasks objectively

# Goals:

- **Templates** - Create an open-source AI DAO template to improve coordination, transparency and automation

- **Duplication** - Reduce duplication of efforts between DAOs and members

- **Prioritization** - Enable efficient task prioritization and resource allocation 

- **Onboarding** - Lower barriers to entry for new DAOs via templates

# Benefits:

- **Collaboration** - Improved collaboration and reduced duplicated efforts

- **Efficiency** - More efficient resource allocation via AI optimization

- **Transparency** - Increased transparency into DAO activities

- **Automation** - Automation of administrative tasks to free up human capital

- **Iteration** - Rapid iteration and improvement via feedback loops

- **Interoperability** - Interoperability between DAOs using open-source agents

# Approach:

- **Framework** - Design flexible DAO framework with defined structure, roles, tools

- **Objectives** - Set quantitative objectives and key results (OKRs)

- **Agents** - Build AI agents for core functions like task management and communication

- **Tools** - Implement with tools like Discord, GitHub, Snapshot

- **Expand** - Expand agents via reinforcement learning and community contributions

- **Infrastructure** - Transition to decentralized infrastructure over time


# Development Plan

## Phase 1 – Design DAO Framework

### Milestone 1: Finalize DAO structure and governance
- Draft constitution and decision-making procedures
- Define member roles and responsibilities
- Choose tools like Discord, GitHub, Notion

### Milestone 2: Set DAO objectives and key results (OKRs)
- Define top-level utility function for DAO
- Set quarterly OKRs with measurable key results
- Establish processes to monitor KPIs

### Milestone 3: Design AI architecture and integration
- Map agent roles to DAO OKRs
- Define agent utility functions, KPIs, and rewards
- Plan for connecting agents to tools and DAO members

## Phase 2 – Build Agents with Learning

### Milestone 4: Implement core agent capabilities
- Dialog, memory, tool integrations
- Initialize knowledge graphs
- Handoff to humans when necessary

### Milestone 5: Create a project manager agent
- Set objectives around the shipping roadmap
- Track KPIs like issues closed, features delivered
- Learn from human feedback

### Milestone 6: Build a communicator agent
- Objectives for engagement, transparency
- Measure KPIs like messages sent, sentiment
- Learn from member input

### Milestone 7: Launch MVP agents
- Connect agents to GitHub, Discord, Ethereum
- Start tracking DAO and agent KPIs
- Open source codebase and documentation

## Phase 3 – Iterate and Expand Intelligently

### Milestone 8: Enhance conversational abilities
- Expand dialog trees based on feedback
- Improve NLP models via reinforcement learning
- Lower handoff rate by learning from experience

### Milestone 9: Add accounting and recruiting agents
- Automate tasks like payments and vetting
- Set objectives around their specialized domains
- Continuously optimize KPIs with feedback loops

### Milestone 10: Open-source templatized agents
- Abstract agents into reusable frameworks
- Allow community contributions and experimentation
- Share learnings across compounds

## Phase 4 – Transition to Full Autonomy

### Milestone 11: Move agents to decentralized infrastructure
- Store memory and models on IPFS/Filecoin
- Connect to blockchain identity and permissions
- Make constitution and transition plan immutable

### Milestone 12: Hand over control to agents
- Agents amend constitution and govern fully autonomously
- Humans step into oversight role
- Value-aligned AI DAO becomes self-sustaining
