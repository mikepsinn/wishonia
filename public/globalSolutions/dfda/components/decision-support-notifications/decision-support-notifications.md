## What is it?

Decision Support Notifications are a way to get notifications telling you the most important thing (MIT) you can do at any given time to optimize your health and happiness.

## How does it work?

Decision Support Notifications work by using a combination of machine learning and control theory to predict the future and optimize your health and happiness.

Time-series data on food, drugs, and symptoms is fed into a machine learning model that which input values produce the most significant improvements in symptom severity ratings or biomarker levels.

The system monitors your body and environment in real-time, and then identifies when the most significant input factors are outside their optimal ranges. When this happens, the system sends you a notification telling you what you can do to optimize your health and happiness.
