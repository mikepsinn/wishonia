# üíñ RIGHT TO TRIAL ACT: Executive Summary

This Act guarantees patient rights to participate in decentralized trials for the most promising treatment. It achieves
this through a free, open-source, decentralized trial platform that eliminates billions in trial costs, rewards
companies for developing cures and prevention, and removes barriers to accessing effective treatments.

## üìú SECTION 1. Core Problems & Solutions

Today's healthcare system suffers from bureaucratic FDA delays, limited clinical trial access, exorbitant drug
development costs, and a focus on expensive treatments. The Right to Trial Act solves these problems by:

* **Guaranteeing universal access:** Every person has the right to try treatments after basic safety testing.
* **Creating a free, open platform:** Eliminates billions in trial costs and accelerates development.
* **Rewarding cures and prevention:** Incentivizes the development of affordable, effective treatments.
* **Removing access barriers:** Streamlines the process and makes treatments readily available.
* **Utilizing real-world evidence:**  Continuously analyzes treatment outcomes to optimize care.
* **Employing AI-powered analysis:**  Provides continuous monitoring and optimization of treatments.

## üåê SECTION 2. The Decentralized Trial Platform

The Decentralized FDA is a free, public, decentralized trial platform that replaces traditional Phase 1-4 trials with
continuous real-world evidence collection. Key features include:

* **Universal Participation:**  Any patient can participate from anywhere, using telemedicine and mobile apps.
* **Automated Outcome Tracking:**  The system automatically tracks safety and effectiveness, generating better evidence
  faster.
* **AI-Powered Analysis:**  FDAi continuously analyzes data, identifies optimal treatments, and provides early warnings
  of safety issues.
* **Open Source and Global:**  The platform is open-source, enabling global collaboration and continuous improvement.

## üîì SECTION 3. Financial Incentives for Cures

The Act introduces a Healthcare Savings Sharing Program where manufacturers and society split healthcare savings (e.g.,
from age-related disease prevention) 50/50. This incentivizes the development of cures and preventative treatments,
leading to lower costs, faster access, and better health outcomes. The program eliminates government-imposed fees and
enables importation of treatments, fostering true price competition and preventing price gouging.

## üåü SECTION 4. Benefits Over the Current System

The Right to Trial Act offers significant advantages:

* **Cheaper:** Eliminates billions in costs, enables global price competition, and shares savings.
* **Faster:** Removes years of delays, automates processes, and enables real-time monitoring.
* **Better:** Includes all willing patients, generates real-world evidence, and continuously improves treatments.
