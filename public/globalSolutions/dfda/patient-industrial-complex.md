# üèõÔ∏è Patient Industrial Complex Advocacy System

## üìú Overview

The Patient Industrial Complex (PIC) uses tokens to reward actions that advance
the [Cure Acceleration Act](https://wishonia.love/dfda/right-to-trial-act) and reduce patient suffering. The token has no
intrinsic value - it's simply a point system to incentivize and coordinate collective action.
