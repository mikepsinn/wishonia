upfront costs, they encourage more people to use the therapy, increasing total savings and their earnings.

### **Q2: How does this model benefit healthcare systems financially?**

**A:** Healthcare systems save money by eliminating the high costs associated with long-term treatment of chronic
diseases. The savings can be substantial and can be reallocated to other healthcare priorities.

### **Q3: What diseases could this model impact?**

**A:** This model is particularly effective for diseases with high lifetime treatment costs and significant prevalence,
such as heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes.

### **Q4: How are the savings and developer earnings calculated?**

**A:** Savings are calculated based on the average lifetime cost of treating the disease. Developers receive 50% of the
savings for each patient treated. Independent audits ensure accuracy and fairness.

### **Q5: What about diseases that are rare or have low treatment costs?**

**A:** While the model is most impactful for common, costly diseases, it can be adapted for rare diseases by adjusting
the profit-sharing percentage or combining efforts across multiple conditions.

### **How the System Benefits Preventative and Longevity Therapies**

#### **1. Savings are Based on Reduced Average Healthcare Costs**

- **For Preventative Therapies**:
    - Savings are calculated based on reduction in average per capita healthcare costs across the treated population.
    - Example: If average annual healthcare costs
      are $12,000 per person, and a preventative therapy reduces this by 15%, the annual savings are $1,800 per person.
      Over a 10-year period, this amounts to $18,000 in savings, with the manufacturer earning $9,000 per patient.

- **For Longevity Therapies**:
    - Savings are measured by comparing healthcare costs of treated populations against baseline per capita costs for
      their age group.
    - Example: If a longevity therapy reduces average healthcare costs for people aged 65-75 from $18,000 to $13,000 per
      year, the annual savings are $5,000. Over a 10-year period, this generates $50,000 in savings, with the
      manufacturer earning $25,000 per patient.

---

#### **2. No Need for Specific Endpoints**

- Traditional drug trials often require **specific endpoints** (e.g., "Does the drug cure or improve this condition?"),
  which can be hard to define for preventative or longevity therapies. Under this system:
    - The **endpoint is cost savings**, not specific clinical results.
    - Real-world data measures the reduction in healthcare spending over time, making the system inherently adaptable to
      therapies that work across multiple conditions or improve overall health.

---

#### **3. Incentivizing Long-Term Benefits**

- Therapies with compounding benefits (e.g., reducing disease risk over decades or extending healthy lifespan) would
  still qualify for savings-sharing payments as long as real-world data shows reduced costs over time.
- Longevity therapies that target multiple conditions simultaneously—like cellular reprogramming or gene editing—can
  generate savings across a broad spectrum of healthcare expenses, increasing rewards for manufacturers.

---

### **How the System Handles Long-Term Impact**

1. **Ongoing Savings Calculation**:
    - For preventative and longevity therapies, savings are calculated over a long period using real-world data.
    - Example: If a therapy reduces annual healthcare costs by $10,000 for 20 years, the total savings are $200,000,
      with the manufacturer earning $100,000.

2. **Continuous Monitoring**:
    - The decentralized FDA platform tracks patient health outcomes and healthcare costs over time to measure the
      therapy's impact.
    - Payments to manufacturers are adjusted dynamically based on actual savings achieved.

3. **Broad Application**:
    - Preventative and longevity therapies that provide diffuse or long-term benefits still qualify for rewards, even
      without targeting a single disease or condition.
    - Example: A therapy that slows aging could reduce the incidence of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and dementia,
      generating savings across multiple categories.

---

### **Specific Changes to Traditional Requirements**

#### **1. No Single Disease Endpoint**:

- Preventative and longevity therapies are rewarded based on **multi-condition savings** rather than curing or
  preventing one specific disease.

#### **2. Long-Term Real-World Data Collection**:

- The system relies on **anonymized, decentralized data** to measure healthcare cost reductions over decades, making it
  feasible to track the impact of longevity therapies.

#### **3. Incentivizing Early Adoption**:

- Manufacturers are incentivized to make therapies widely available early, as larger populations and longer treatment
  durations maximize savings-sharing rewards.

---

### **Example Applications**

#### **Preventative Therapy**: A Universal Cancer Vaccine

- **Scenario**: A vaccine prevents common cancers, saving $500,000 per patient in lifetime treatment costs.
- **Savings Sharing**: The manufacturer earns $250,000 per patient.
- **Impact**: Large-scale adoption reduces the global cancer burden and generates sustainable rewards for the developer.

#### **Longevity Therapy**: Epigenetic Reprogramming

- **Scenario**: A therapy extends healthy lifespan by 10 years, delaying age-related diseases and saving $10,000/year in
  healthcare costs.
- **Savings Sharing**: The manufacturer earns $5,000/year per patient for 10 years, or $50,000 total.
- **Impact**: By delaying multiple diseases, the therapy generates rewards from aggregate cost reductions.

---

### **Key Benefits for Preventative and Longevity Therapies**

1. **Eliminates the Endpoint Problem**:
    - Success is measured in cost savings, not disease-specific outcomes, making the system ideal for broad-impact
      therapies.
2. **Encourages Long-Term Thinking**:
    - Manufacturers are incentivized to develop therapies with long-lasting benefits.
3. **Accelerates Adoption**:
    - Patients benefit sooner from preventative and longevity therapies without waiting for traditional trial endpoints.
