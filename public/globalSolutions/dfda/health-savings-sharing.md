# The Health Savings Sharing Program: Cutting Healthcare Costs in Half By Incentivizing Cures and Preventative Therapies

---

Imagine a world where diseases like heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's are not just managed but cured. A world where
healthcare costs decrease, and life-changing treatments are accessible to everyone. This vision can become a reality
with an innovative plan that aligns the interests of pharmaceutical companies, patients, and healthcare systems.

---

## **The Problem: High Costs and Lifelong Treatments**

### **Chronic Diseases Are Expensive**

- **Financial Burden on Patients and Systems:** Diseases such as heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes cost
  individuals and healthcare systems enormous amounts over a person's lifetime.
- **Ongoing Treatments Instead of Cures:** Many treatments manage symptoms without curing the disease, requiring
  patients to undergo continuous therapy and medication.
- **Limited Incentives for Cures:** Pharmaceutical companies often focus on treatments that provide ongoing revenue
  rather than investing in one-time cures.

---

## **The Solution: An Incentive Model That Rewards Cures**

### **Introducing a New Approach**

Our proposal offers a transformative way to encourage the development of cures and preventative therapies:

- **Profit Sharing Based on Savings:** Guarantee developers 50% of the average healthcare cost savings for each patient
  who uses their curative or preventative treatment.
- **Lower Upfront Costs for Patients:** Companies offer therapies at low or no initial cost, making them accessible to
  more people.
- **Mutual Benefits:** Patients receive affordable cures, healthcare systems save money, and companies profit from
  shared savings.

---

## **How It Works: A Simple Breakdown**

### **1. Development of a Cure or Preventative Therapy**

Pharmaceutical companies invest in creating treatments that can completely cure a disease or prevent it from occurring.

### **2. Calculation of Average Healthcare Savings**

- **Determine Lifetime Costs:** Estimate the average cost of treating the disease over a patient's lifetime.
    - *Example:* Treating heart disease may cost **$750,000** per patient.
- **Potential Savings:** This amount represents the savings if the disease is cured or prevented.

### **3. Agreement on Profit Sharing**

- **50% Savings Share:** The company receives 50% of the healthcare cost savings for each patient cured.
    - *In our example:* The company earns **$375,000** per patient (50% of $750,000).

### **4. Accessible Pricing of the Therapy**

- **Minimize Upfront Costs:** Offer the therapy at little to no cost to patients to encourage widespread use.
- **Maximizing Adoption:** Lowering financial barriers increases the number of patients who can benefit.

### **5. Treatment and Cure of Patients**

- **Wide Adoption:** Patients receive the therapy without financial obstacles.
- **Improved Health Outcomes:** Patients are cured or prevented from developing the disease.

### **6. Sharing the Savings**

- **Healthcare Systems Save Money:** Costs associated with long-term disease management are eliminated.
- **Company Receives Payment:** The company earns its share of the savings for each patient treated.

---

## **The Benefits: A Win-Win for Everyone**

### **For Patients**

- **Affordable Access to Cures:** Financial barriers are removed, making life-changing treatments available to all.
- **Better Health and Quality of Life:** Cures eliminate diseases, reducing suffering and improving daily living.
- **Financial Relief:** No more ongoing expenses for treatments, medications, or hospital visits.

### **For Healthcare Systems and Insurers**

- **Significant Cost Savings:** Reducing or eliminating chronic diseases lowers overall healthcare expenditures.
- **Resource Reallocation:** Funds saved can be invested in other critical areas, such as preventive care or research.
- **Simplified Care Management:** Less need for managing chronic conditions over time.

### **For Pharmaceutical Companies**

- **Profitable Business Model:** Earning a share of the savings can lead to substantial profits, especially when
  treating large populations.
- **Incentive to Innovate:** Strong financial rewards motivate companies to invest in developing cures.
- **Enhanced Reputation:** Contributing to societal health boosts public image and trust.

### **For Society**

- **Healthier Population:** Reduced disease prevalence leads to increased productivity and well-being.
- **Economic Growth:** Lower healthcare costs and a healthier workforce positively impact the economy.
- **Reduced Health Inequality:** Equal access to cures helps bridge the gap in healthcare disparities.

## **Illustrative Financial Example**

Let's consider the impact of curing common age-related diseases collectively.

### **Scenario**

- **Diseases Addressed:** Heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and more.
- **Total Expected Lifetime Healthcare Cost per Person:** **$388,500**
- **Developer's Potential Earnings per Person:** **$194,250** (50% of savings)
- **Population Size:** 1 million people
- **Cost to Develop and Distribute the Therapy per Person:** **$10,000**

### **Calculations**

1. **Total Healthcare Savings:**
    - $388,500 (savings per person) × 1,000,000 (people) = **$388.5 billion**

2. **Total Developer Earnings:**
    - $194,250 (earnings per person) × 1,000,000 (people) = **$194.25 billion**

3. **Developer Profit:**
    - $194.25 billion (earnings) - $10 billion (development costs) = **$184.25 billion**

4. **Healthcare System Savings:**
    - Remaining 50% of savings: **$194.25 billion**

### **Summary**

- **Patients Benefit:** Receive cures at little to no cost.
- **Healthcare Systems Save:** $194.25 billion that can be reallocated.
- **Developers Profit:** Substantial earnings incentivize innovation.

diseases. The savings can be substantial and can be reallocated to other healthcare priorities.

### **Q3: What diseases could this model impact?**

**A:** This model is particularly effective for diseases with high lifetime treatment costs and significant prevalence,
such as heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes.

### **Q4: How are the savings and developer earnings calculated?**

**A:** Savings are calculated based on the average lifetime cost of treating the disease. Developers receive 50% of the
savings for each patient treated. Independent audits ensure accuracy and fairness.

### **Q5: What about diseases that are rare or have low treatment costs?**

**A:** While the model is most impactful for common, costly diseases, it can be adapted for rare diseases by adjusting
the profit-sharing percentage or combining efforts across multiple conditions.
